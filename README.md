## Project Title
**Prodesk IT – Digital Agency Landing Page**

---

## Project Mission

Design and develop a modern, responsive landing page for a fictional digital marketing agency named **Prodesk IT**.  
The project focuses on mastering **frontend fundamentals** before moving to advanced frameworks like React or backend technologies.

---

## Why This Project?

This project exists to strengthen core frontend concepts such as:

- DOM structure using semantic HTML
- CSS layout systems (Flexbox & Grid)
- Responsive design principles
- UI micro-interactions
- Dark mode implementation
- Modern UI trends like Glassmorphism

Frameworks can hide weak fundamentals.  
This project ensures strong control over layout, styling, and interaction logic.

---

## Difficulty Level Chosen

**Level 3 – Advanced**

This level builds on basic and intermediate requirements and introduces:

- Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
- Glassmorphism UI design
- Dark mode using class-based toggling
- Performance-optimized and accessible layout

---

## Tech Stack Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| HTML5 | Semantic structure and accessibility |
| Tailwind CSS | Styling, layout, and responsiveness |
| JavaScript (Vanilla) | Dark mode toggle and interactions |
| CSS Glassmorphism | Modern frosted-glass UI effect |
| Chrome DevTools | Performance and Lighthouse audit |

---

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Responsive breakpoints using Tailwind utilities
- Flexbox and Grid for layout control

---

### 2. Glassmorphism Navbar
- Fixed and sticky navigation bar
- Semi-transparent background
- `backdrop-blur` effect
- Soft borders and shadows

This creates a modern frosted-glass appearance.

---

### 3. Dark Mode Functionality
- Tailwind configured with `darkMode: 'class'`
- Dark mode toggled by adding/removing `dark` class on `<html>`
- Scalable and performance-friendly approach

---

### 4. Micro-Interactions
- Button hover scaling
- Service card lift effects
- Smooth transitions for better UX

These interactions enhance user engagement.

---

### 5. Performance & Accessibility
Target Lighthouse scores:

| Category | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Performance | 100 |
| Accessibility | 100 |
| Best Practices | 100 |
| SEO | 100 |

Achieved using:
- Minimal JavaScript
- No unused CSS
- Semantic HTML
- Clean layout structure

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, the developer can:

- Build professional UIs using Tailwind CSS
- Implement dark mode correctly
- Design modern UI effects like Glassmorphism
- Create responsive, accessible layouts
- Confidently move to React or other frontend frameworks

---

## Future Enhancements

- Mobile hamburger menu
- React component conversion
- Advanced animations
- Deployment on Netlify or Vercel

---

## Final Note

This project is not a tutorial clone.  
It is a **foundation-building exercise** designed to develop real frontend engineering skills.
