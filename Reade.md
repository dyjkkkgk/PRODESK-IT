# Level 2 – AI Prompt (LocalStorage & Delete Feature)

```
Upgrade the existing Vanilla JavaScript project to Level 2.

Add the following features:

1. Store salary and expense list in browser localStorage.
2. On page load, retrieve stored data and render it on the UI.
3. Display all expenses dynamically using DOM manipulation.
4. Add a delete (trash) button next to each expense item.
5. When an expense is deleted:
   - Remove it from the expenses array
   - Update the DOM instantly
   - Update localStorage
   - Recalculate and update remaining balance

Constraints:
- Use JSON.stringify() to store data
- Use JSON.parse() to retrieve data
- No frameworks (React, Vue, Angular not allowed)
- No page reloads

Ensure the logic is clean, functional, and error-free.
```
